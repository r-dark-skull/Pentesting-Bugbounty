#### Give a STAR if you appricaitae our work or Weekly InfoSec Update provide value to you.   
    
## In the future,

   1. Weekly Infosec Update
   
     ‚Ä¢ Shifting to a website with freemium subscription model for #WeeklyInfosecUpdate.
     ‚Ä¢ Add more categories such as daily, Infosec Weekly, Developers Weekly and monthly Reccap.
     ‚Ä¢ Newsletter Service to Organization.
    
   2. Create a public knowledge db
   
     ‚Ä¢ Make it a wiki
     ‚Ä¢ Crowdsorce the Content.
        
<details>
<summary><b>Preview</b></summary>

 Future plans detailed:
  1. The final version of Weekly Infosec Update will be a website that will contain categorised content for Professional and beginners. it would be something like packetstorm, but only with useful information.
    
    There will be categories such as:
     ‚Ä¢ Daily infosec updates - may contain less important news, but on a daily basis
     ‚Ä¢ Weekly infosec updates - general weekly news 
     ‚Ä¢ Monthly Infosec Updates - only the most important things that happened during a month
     ‚Ä¢ Breach news -  big breaches
     ‚Ä¢ Critical news - news such as log4shell
     ‚Ä¢ New TTPs - new tactics techniques and  procedures
     The list of categories may get bigger

  2. Public knowledge DB
    
    - It would be something between mitre att&ck and an obsidian notebook. If you ever took notes while learning, you know what am i talking about. It will contain not only techniques like in mitre, but as well as POCs and explanation how it works + resources for more details. 
    - The knowledge db will be a wiki, so anyone could contribute with their notes or blog posts. Every post will be categorised and chained like in obsidian notebook, so by reading a post, you will see many more posts related to the same subject. This way we will crowdsource our knowledge and help each other in our infosec journey
    
  3. Offline Meeteups in City/country and support Cybersecurity project/event.
  
  4. We're planning to start a Chapters for ResetHacker Community in different city and country so if you have expiriance with leading community, group and leaders do reach out to us at (resethackerofficial@gmail.com) and Capter name will be Eg : RH-County/City/Community/group/Team name.
  
  5. Collebration with venue for Events.
