     - [Added module for CVE-2022-40684 in Metasploit framework](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/pull/17143)
     - [Detection for SOC](https://www.horizon3.ai/fortinet-iocs-cve-2022-40684/)
     - [Fortinet devices possibly vulnerable to CVE-2022-40684 on Netlas.io](https://app.netlas.io/responses/?q=tag.name%3A(fortinet%20OR%20fortigate_vpn)&amp;page=1&amp;indices=)

     - Vendor : **Fortinet FortiGate**
     - Affected :  FortiOS version 7.2.0 through 7.2.1 and 7.0.0 through 7.0.6, FortiProxy version 7.2.0 and version 7.0.0 through 7.0.6 and FortiSwitchManager version 7.2.0 and 7.0.0 
     - Patched : Apply updates per vendor instructions.
     - Discription : An authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel [CWE-288] in Fortinet FortiOS , FortiProxy and FortiSwitchManager allows an unauthenticated atttacker to perform operations on the administrative interface via specially crafted HTTP or HTTPS requests.
                          
              
   - [Analysis : Exploitation of Zimbra 0Day CVE 2022-41352 ](https://securelist.com/ongoing-exploitation-of-cve-2022-41352-zimbra-0-day/107703/)                   
                                     
       - Target/Product: **Zimbra**
       - Discription/Issue/Flaw : The vulnerability affects a component of the Zimbra suite called Amavis, and more specifically the cpio utility it uses to extract archives. The underlying cause is another vulnerability (CVE-2015-1197) in cpio, for which a fix is available. Inexplicably, distribution maintainers appear to have reverted the patch and use a vulnerable version instead. This creates a large attack surface where any software relying on cpio might in theory be leveraged to take over the system. CVE-2015-1197 is a directory traversal vulnerability: extracting specially crafted archives containing symbolic links can cause files to be placed at an arbitrary location in the file system.

       - Target/Product: **Microsoft** 
       - Discription/Issue/Flaw : CVE-2022-42889 Text4Shell: An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability may gain SYSTEM privileges. The 0-day exploit can execute the privilege escalation successfully on Windows 10 and Windows 11 prior to the September patch. The cause of the vulnerability is due to the lack of a strict bounds check on the field cbSymbolZone in the Base Record Header for the base log file (BLF) in CLFS.sys. If the field cbSymbolZone is set to an invalid offset, an out-of-bound write will occur at the invalid offset. In this two-part blog series, we will demystify the vulnerability and the 0-day exploit discovered in-the-wild. The blogs consist of two parts: an analysis of the root cause, and an analysis of the exploit. In this blog, we first present a detailed analysis of the root cause for CVE-2022-37969.

First file that is created in subdirectory is in format <random 4 numbers>_<filename> then later this file is moved to just <filename> (leading numbers and underscore are removed).This directory have DACL's that dont allow unprivileged users to modify/delete newly created files but it will allow user to create junction. This can abused by creating junction point to user controlled directory which have more permissive DACL's , this way when new files are created in subdirectories user will be able to modify them and leverage it to obtain arbitrary file move which leads to LPE by writing dll in system32 directory that is later loaded by privileged service. Current PoC will load dll in windows update service, dll dont implement any kind of mutex to check if exploit was already executed which result in creating multiple cmd.exe process as dll is loaded multiple times.

       - Target/Product: **Zimbra**
       - Discription/Issue/Flaw : The vulnerability affects a component of the Zimbra suite called Amavis, and more specifically the cpio utility it uses to extract archives. The underlying cause is another vulnerability (CVE-2015-1197) in cpio, for which a fix is available. Inexplicably, distribution maintainers appear to have reverted the patch and use a vulnerable version instead. This creates a large attack surface where any software relying on cpio might in theory be leveraged to take over the system. CVE-2015-1197 is a directory traversal vulnerability: extracting specially crafted archives containing symbolic links can cause files to be placed at an arbitrary location in the file system.

First file that is created in subdirectory is in format <random 4 numbers>_<filename> then later this file is moved to just <filename> (leading numbers and underscore are removed).This directory have DACL's that dont allow unprivileged users to modify/delete newly created files but it will allow user to create junction. This can abused by creating junction point to user controlled directory which have more permissive DACL's , this way when new files are created in subdirectories user will be able to modify them and leverage it to obtain arbitrary file move which leads to LPE by writing dll in system32 directory that is later loaded by privileged service. Current PoC will load dll in windows update service, dll dont implement any kind of mutex to check if exploit was already executed which result in creating multiple cmd.exe process as dll is loaded multiple times.

    - Target & Version : **Ubuntu Touch 16.04**
    - Title : Privilage escalation in Ubuntu Touch 16.04 - by PIN Bruteforce
    - Description : Ubuntu Touch allows you to "protect" devices with a 4-digit passcode. Such a code was set in a demonstration device. The problem is that the same 4-digit passcode then becomes a password that we can use with the sudo command and gain root privileges. This means that a malicious application can do us double harm:
                        1. Easily escalate privileges and take control of the device.
                        2. It can pass the screen unlock passcode to a third party.

    - Title : JetBrains Hub pre-auth semi-blind server-side request forgery (SSRF).
    
    - Description : JetBrains Hub before 2021.1.14276 was vulneable to improper access control (CVE-2022-34894), which allows an attacker create untrusted services without authentication even if guest user is disabled. This makes it possible to exploit the vulnerablity without any other requirements (normally an attacker should be at least authenticated). The vulnerability was possible due to use of Apache Batik with default settings for user-supplied SVG icon rasterization.
